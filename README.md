# speech-games-client

This project provides simple games for speech therapy. 

It is entirely implemented in client-side javascript and only accesses a minimal json-server (see https://github.com/isawzz/speech-games-server) to store user data.

easiest way to run this if you have vs code installed:
1. clone the repos in a directory

2. open directory in vs code

3. if you do not have Live Server extension, install it in vs code extensions tab

4. press GoLive

5. start in S directory 

S/settings contains a settings file settings.yaml that can be adapted to use the implemented games with different parameters. right now, just file editing in settings ui.

Note: HAS ONLY BEEN TESTED ON *** GOOGLE CHROME ***
